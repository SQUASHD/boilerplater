This will demonstrate your understanding of web service creation, external API integration, and best practices in coding.\",\n  \"features\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Start and Stop Time Tracking\",\n      \"description\": \"Feature to start and stop time tracking for a given task.\",\n      \"tips\": [\"Understand how to handle HTTP requests and responses in Go.\", \"Manage time efficiently in Go.\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Generate Timekeeping Records\",\n      \"description\": \"Feature to generate timekeeping records based on the tracked time.\",\n      \"tips\": [\"Learn how to generate and format reports.\", \"Ensure correct calculations for time worked.\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Integrate with an Email API\",\n      \"description\": \"Feature to automatically send the generated timekeeping records to the employer.\",\n      \"tips\": [\"Research and choose a suitable Email API.\", \"Understand how to use API keys securely.\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"steps\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Set up your development environment and initialize your project with version control (e.g., Git).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Design and implement the API for starting and stopping time tracking.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Implement the feature to generate timekeeping records.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Integrate with an Email API to send the records to the employer.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Write comprehensive documentation for your project, explaining how to use the web service and its features.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Ensure your code follows best practices for coding in Go, and add appropriate comments to explain complex code sections.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Test your web service thoroughly, fix any bugs and refactor your code as necessary.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"setup\": \"Install Go and any necessary libraries. Initialize your project with Git for version control.\",\n  \"testing\": \"Write unit tests for your functions and integration tests for your web service as a whole. Use a Go testing framework and ensure all tests pass before considering the project complete.\",\n  \"debugging\": \"Use Go's built-in debugging tools to identify and fix issues. Regularly check your application logs for any errors or unexpected behaviour.\",\n  \"extras\": [\"Add authentication to your API.\", \"Deploy your web service to a cloud provider for real-world testing.\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis project will help you deepen your understanding of web service creation, API integration, and best practices in Go programming. Additionally, it will add a valuable piece to your portfolio demonstrating your intermediate programming skills."
