# AI Prompt Parsing and Response Server

## Objective

To develop a server in Go that processes incoming requests, transforms them into AI-friendly prompts, and then
structures the AI's response into a standardized format.

## Detailed Features

### Request Parsing

Interprets and parses incoming requests to extract relevant information for AI prompt generation.

#### Implementation Steps

- Set up an HTTP server to listen for incoming requests.
- Extract data from requests (e.g., headers, body, query parameters).
- Implement logic to identify key elements for prompt creation.

### AI Prompt Generation

Transforms parsed data into a well-structured prompt suitable for AI processing.

#### Implementation Steps

- Design a template for AI prompts based on request data.
- Incorporate error handling to manage incomplete or incorrect data.
- Ensure prompt structure aligns with AI model requirements.

### AI Response Processing

Processes the AI's response and converts it into a structured format.

#### Implementation Steps

- Receive and parse the AI's raw response.
- Transform the response into a predefined structured format.
- Handle any errors or anomalies in the AI's response.

## Development Process

### Setup

Initialize the Go environment and project structure, including necessary libraries and dependencies.

### Phases

1. Phase 1: Environment Setup and Basic Server Implementation
2. Phase 2: Implementation of Request Parsing and Prompt Generation
3. Phase 3: Integration with AI and Response Structuring
4. Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization

### Testing

Implement unit and integration tests at each development phase to ensure functionality and reliability.

### Debugging

Use Go's debugging tools and logging to identify and resolve issues during development.

## Challenges

- Ensuring accurate and efficient parsing of diverse request formats.
- Designing prompts that effectively utilize the AI's capabilities.
- Handling the variability and unpredictability of AI responses.
- Maintaining performance and scalability of the server.
