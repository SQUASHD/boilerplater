# Boilerplater - AI-Driven Boilerplate Generation App 

## Overview

Boilerplater is designed to enhance the creative process for developers at all levels.
It uses the power of generative AI combined with user input to generate structured project outlines. 
The tool aims to provide a springboard for creativity, offering direction without
generating actual code - a unique blend of guidance and creative freedom.

## Key Components

1. **CLI/TUI for Prompt Generation**: (to be determined)
   - A user-friendly interface allowing users to input their project ideas.

2. **Server-Side Processing**: 
   - Inputs are sent to a server where AI processes them into refined, curated prompts.

3. **Structured Response Generation**: 
   - The server returns a structured response comprising:
     A) **Project Overview**: A brief yet comprehensive description of the project's aim and scope.
     B) **Project Structure**: Suggested archicecture (directories and files)
     C) **Boilerplate Functions**: Code that may, or may not (hey, it's generative AI) need to be implemented to fulfill the project outline

## Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to streamline the project initiation phase, particularly for:
- **Beginners**: Offering a structured starting point to guide their early projects.
- **Advanced Programmers**: Providing a platform to quickly conceptualize and organize new ideas.

## How It Works

1. **Input Phase**: Users input their initial project ideas or requirements through the CLI/TUI.
2. **Processing Phase**: These inputs are sent to the server, where the input is processed nto detailed, structured prompts.
3. **Output Phase**: The app outputs a well-organized project framework, including an overview, structure, and suggested boilerplate elements.
