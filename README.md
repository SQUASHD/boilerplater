# Boilerplater - AI-Driven Boilerplate Generation App 

## Overview

Boilerplater is designed to enhance the creative process for developers at all levels.
It combines the power of AI with user input to generate structured project outlines. 
The tool aims to provide a springboard for creativity, offering direction without
generating actual code, fostering a unique blend of guidance and creative freedom.

## Key Components

1. **CLI/TUI for Prompt Generation**: (to be determined)
   - A user-friendly interface allowing users to input their project ideas.

2. **Server-Side Processing**: 
   - Inputs are sent to a server where AI processes them into refined, curated prompts.

3. **Structured Response Generation**: 
   - The server returns a structured response comprising:
     A) **Project Overview**: A brief yet comprehensive description of the project's aim and scope.
     B) **Project Structure**: An outline of the proposed project's architecture, detailing essential components and their interrelations.
     C) **Boilerplate Functions and Files**: Suggestions for relevant functions and file structures (note: actual content is not included).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to streamline the project initiation phase, particularly for:
- **Beginners**: Offering a structured starting point to guide their early projects.
- **Advanced Programmers**: Providing a platform to quickly conceptualize and organize new ideas.

## How It Works

1. **Input Phase**: Users input their initial project ideas or requirements through the CLI/TUI.
2. **Processing Phase**: These inputs are sent to the server, where AI(?) algorithms process them into detailed, structured prompts.
3. **Output Phase**: The app outputs a well-organized project framework, including an overview, structure, and suggested boilerplate elements.
